# Ultracopier Dolphin Service Menu
This is a Ultracopier (copy handler) Dolphin Service Menu that aims to integrate the Ultracopier to Dolphin KDE File Manager.

There are two variants:   

Variant A: Using a Submenu.

Variant B: Directly on the Right Click Menu without a submenu.

Currently the destiny folder has to be selected using a KDialog.

#### Future improvements
* Add a Paste entry to avoid the ise of the KDialog destiny selection
* Add Keyboard shortcut (like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+X) not directly allowed on Dolphin Service Menu (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=260266). Posible workarround by using xdotool (https://askubuntu.com/questions/958180/assigning-keyboard-shortcuts-to-kde-dolphin-service-menus)
